## First things first
Hi, my name is Jeff Shee. I'm a Malaysian studying abroad in Japan. I'm born in '95, 25 years old. ✧٩(ˊωˋ*)و✧

## Where I'm from?
I'm from Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan. It is a nice place to hang around -- *A coastal city, best with the sunset, residents are kind!*

## Paradise of Food
As a Malaysian, you won't be surprised that I love **sweet and spicy food**! We Malaysians love all kinds of food, from different cultures. Food is indeed the *soul of Malaysia*.

 1. *Char Kway Teow*
 2. *Laksa*
 3. *Roti Canai*
 4. *Satey*
 5. *Nasi Lemak*
 6. *Rendang*
 7. *Durian*
 8. *Teh Tarik*
 9. *Air Batu Campur (ABC)*
 10. *Cendol*

## Not that I want to brag, but
I'm multilingual. I understand and speak in:
- *Mandarin* (mother tongue)
- *Cantonese* (learned from watching Hong Kong drama lol)
- *Bahasa Malaysia* (national language)
- *English* (international, so not surprising)
- *Japanese* (spent 2 years before going to Japan)

However, I'm more prefer listening to other people's stories rather than speaking. I'm a shy boii lol. (〃▽〃)

## More about me
I'm a normal guy who loves anime and enjoys programming sometimes. My favorite anime genres are *Action*, *Adventure*, *Comedy*, *Slice of Life*, and *Romance*. You are welcome to take a peek at my watch list at [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/jeffshee/
) (constantly update).

Not only anime and programming, but I also enjoy listening to music, photographing, cooking, playing PC games, jogging, cycling, hiking, etc. Recently, I also started learning guitar and going to the gym. (*•̀ᴗ•́*)و ̑̑
